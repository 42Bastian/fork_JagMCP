// A container of a move-only type still *declares* a copy constructor, which
// only fails when it is instantiated. A type holding one therefore looks
// copy-constructible, and a container whose move is not noexcept -- true of
// MSVC's unordered_map -- reaches for that copy and fails deep inside the
// standard library. Owning types say `= delete` rather than leaving it to be
// derived.

// A standard container's iterator is a pointer on libc++ and a class type on
// MSVC, so `auto*` deduces from one and not from the other. Nothing can be
// asserted either way, since both are conforming -- which is exactly why it is
// written down: never deduce a raw pointer from an iterator. It is `auto const`
// at every such site, and readability-qualified-auto, which asks for the other
// spelling, is off in `.clang-tidy` for that reason.
